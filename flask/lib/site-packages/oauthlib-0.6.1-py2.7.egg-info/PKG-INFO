        OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
        prominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or
        both of the following:
        
        1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.
        2. They predate the `OAuth 2.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 6749.
        3. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.
        
        .. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849
        .. _`OAuth 2.0 spec`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
        
        OAuthLib is a generic utility which implements the logic of OAuth without
        assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth
        client support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provider support onto your
        favourite web framework. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
        veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.
        
        
        Documentation
        --------------
        
        Full documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_. All contributions are very
        welcome! The documentation is still quite sparse, please open an issue for what
        you'd like to know, or discuss it in our `G+ community`_, or even better, send a
        pull request!

        Interested in making OAuth requests?
        ------------------------------------
        
        Then you might be more interested in using `requests`_ which has OAuthLib
        powered OAuth support provided by the `requests-oauthlib`_ library.

        Which web frameworks are supported?
        -----------------------------------
        
        The following packages provide OAuth support using OAuthLib.
        
        - For Django there is `django-oauth-toolkit`_, which includes `Django REST framework`_ support.
        - For Flask there is `flask-oauthlib`_.
        
        If you have written an OAuthLib package that supports your favorite framework,
        please open a Pull Request, updating the documentation.

        Using OAuthLib? Please get in touch!
        ------------------------------------
        Patching OAuth support onto an http request framework? Creating an OAuth
        provider extension for a web framework? Simply using OAuthLib to Get Things Done
        or to learn?
        
        No matter which we'd love to hear from you in our `G+ community`_ or if you have
        anything in particular you would like to have, change or comment on don't
        hesitate for a second to send a pull request or open an issue. We might be quite
        busy and therefore slow to reply but we love feedback!
        
        Chances are you have run into something annoying that you wish there was
        documentation for, if you wish to gain eternal fame and glory, and a drink if we
        have the pleasure to run into eachother, please send a docs pull request =)

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        *OAuthLib is in active development, with the core of both OAuth 1 and 2
        completed, for providers as well as clients.* See `supported features`_ for
        details.
        
        .. _`supported features`: http://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/feature_matrix.html
        
        0.6.1: Draft revocation endpoint features and numerous fixes including
        
        * (OAuth 2 Provider) is_within_original_scope to check whether a refresh token
          is trying to aquire a new set of scopes that are a subset of the original scope.
        
        * (OAuth 2 Provider) expires_in token lifetime can be set per request.
        
        * (OAuth 2 Provider) client_authentication_required method added to differentiate
          between public and confidential clients.
        
        * (OAuth 2 Provider) rotate_refresh_token now indicates whether a new refresh
          token should be generated during token refresh or if old should be kept.
        
        * (OAuth 2 Provider) returned JSON headers no longer include charset.
        
        * (OAuth 2 Provider) validate_authorizatoin_request now also includes the
          internal request object in the returned dictionary. Note that this is
          not meant to be relied upon heavily and its interface might change.
        
        * and many style and typo fixes.
        
        0.6.0: OAuth 1 & 2 provider API refactor with breaking changes
        
        * All endpoint methods change contract to return 3 values instead of 4. The new
          signature is `headers`, `body`, `status code` where the initial `redirect_uri`
          has been relocated to its rightful place inside headers as `Location`.
        
        * OAuth 1 Access Token Endpoint has a new required validator method 
          `invalidate_request_token`.
        
        * OAuth 1 Authorization Endpoint now returns a 200 response instead of 302 on
          `oob` callbacks. 
        
        0.5.1: OAuth 1 provider fix for incorrect token param in nonce validation.
        
        0.5.0: OAuth 1 provider refactor. OAuth 2 refresh token validation fix.
        
        0.4.2: OAuth 2 draft to RFC. Removed OAuth 2 framework decorators.
        
        0.4.1: Documentation corrections and various small code fixes.
        
        0.4.0: OAuth 2 Provider support (experimental).

        0.3.7: OAuth 1 optional encoding of Client.sign return values
        
        0.3.6: Revert default urlencoding.
        
        0.3.5: Default unicode conversion (utf-8) and urlencoding of input.
        
        0.3.4: A number of small features and bug fixes.
        
        0.3.3: OAuth 1 Provider verify now return useful params
        
        0.3.2: Fixed #62, all Python 3 tests pass.
        
        0.3.1: Python 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 support (experimental)
        
        0.3.0: Initial OAuth 2 client support
        
        0.2.1: Exclude non urlencoded bodies during request verification
        
        0.2.0: OAuth provider support
        
        0.1.4: soft dependency on PyCrypto
        
        0.1.3: use python-rsa instead of pycrypto.
        
        0.1.1 / 0.1.2: Fix installation of pycrypto dependency.
        
        0.1.0: OAuth 1 client functionality seems to be working. Hooray!
        
        0.0.x: In the beginning, there was the word.
